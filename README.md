# Dynamic Systems Analysis of ΛCDM

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, the user requires a Mathematica license and to have installed MaTeX (see https://github.com/szhorvat/MaTeX).

## Analysis

In this notebook, a dynamical systems analysis of the ΛCDM model is carried out. This analysis is presented in Chapter 3 of my thesis. The system includes ODEs for cold dark matter (Z), radiation (R) and the Hubble expansion function (Y), expressed in normalised, compact variables.

This analysis provides a simpler example of the techniques and methods used in the notebooks in the following repositories: Dynamics_Quadratic_EoS, Emerging_Universe and Interacting_Nonlinear_DE.

The analysis in the notebook provides:

+ the fixed points of the system,
+ the full compact 3D phase space,
+ the 3D dynamics on a fixed first integral surface,
+ projection of the dynamics onto the 2D Z-Y plane.
